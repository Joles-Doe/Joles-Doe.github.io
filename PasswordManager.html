                    <h1> Introduction </h1>
                    <p>
                        While completing my Connect 4 project, I delved into the idea of online play a bit more. One thing became apparent: if I were 
                        to connect two computers using peer-to-peer networking, sending their IP addresses to one another would be a huge security risk. 
                        To secure information like this, you’d use encryption to make it harder for any would-be middleman to grab information being sent. 
                        I looked into cryptography, learning about elements such as symmetric encryption. I decided I wanted to put my studies into 
                        practice and make a password manager that incorporated encryption.
                    </p>
                    <h1> Encryption </h1>
                    <p>
                        When designing the password manager, I needed to decide what type of encryption to add. Since I didn’t have a server 
                        to store information on, using something like asymmetric encryption would be hard to implement. In the end, I decided 
                        on using two things – symmetric encryption to encrypt and decrypt passwords, and a hashing function to hide the master key.
                    </p>
                    <div class="inlineMediaContainer">
                        <img src="assets/images/PasswordManagerSnippet1.png">
                        <img src="assets/images/PasswordManagerSnippet2.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        When you open the program for the first time, you are prompted to enter a master password. This master password will be 
                        hashed and is used as the key for the symmetric encryption. When you log back in, you’re prompted to enter your master password again. 
                        The program stores the hashed master password, so when you enter your password to get back in, compares the two hashed passwords 
                        to check if they’re the same. If they are, you log in.
                    </p>
                    <div class="inlineMediaContainer">
                        <img src="assets/images/PasswordManagerSnippet3.png">
                        <img src="assets/images/PasswordManagerSnippet4.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        There is one underlying limitation to this entire program, however. If you were to forget your master password, 
                        there is NO way for you to get it back unless you remember it. This had to be done mostly to prevent storing the 
                        plaintext master password in a file somewhere, or if I were to use some sort of encryption, I would need to store the key 
                        locally. So while this is potentially dangerous for the user if they lose their password, it remains absolutely secure – 
                        if someone were to get a hold of the passwords stored within, they wouldn’t be able to decrypt them without the master password.
                    </p>
                    <h1> What did I learn? </h1>
                    <p> 
                        Whilst not a game, I believe I have learned quite a bit about encryption and how to implement it into a program. Creating a 
                        commercial program was a nice breath of fresh air – I focused on the practical application of cryptography without the limitation 
                        of a game on top of it. I explored various algorithms for encrypting data and applied them to the best of my knowledge. In closing, 
                        this project has expanded my knowledge of cryptography and my application of security in my programs.
