                <h1 class="fontLoraBold"> Introduction </h1>
                <p class="fontLoraSemiBold">
                    Tapper was an idea brought about to demonstrate my C++ skills I had developed thus far. Using SDL as a basis for the graphics program, 
                    I built a small engine that functions on top of it and handles the game. Alongside this small engine, I wanted to build a game on top 
                    as a small challenge. I gave myself a limited timeframe, to mimic a deadline as if I were employed in the games industry. I chose a simple 
                    arcade game mostly due to the fact that you could just turn it on and play it repetitively. To start, I identified the key components 
                    of the engine – taking inspiration from Unity, I had decided to create a system where each object had a function that would be automatically 
                    called by the engine each frame. Using this method makes the code look significantly shorter and cleaner from the engine side – but one problem 
                    persisted. If I needed to delete an object, how would I go about removing it from the engine hierarchy without hardcoding variable names into the engine?
                </p>
                <h1 class="fontLoraBold"> Pointers </h1>
                <p class="fontLoraSemiBold">
                    Through my research, I had discovered a particular pointer that would be integral to the engine – shared pointers. These pointers share 
                    an object and have in-built methods to check if the object they’re pointing to is unique. These pointers gave me an idea – what if, before I 
                    updated every object in my hierarchy, I check if the pointer is unique? If so, remove it and the object from memory. As the engine is always 
                    initialized and constantly in memory, this method prevents memory leaks and automatically cleans up unneeded data from the program.
                </p>
                <h1 class="fontLoraBold"> Object automatic updates </h1>
                <p class="fontLoraSemiBold"> With memory allocation out of the way, I decided to work on my game objects. Like unity, each object would need to inherit 
                    from a base class that included all the necessary functions that the engine may need to call. By using inheritance, I could use shared pointers 
                    of different classes but could still interact with each other as they all possessed the same abstract class. Upon initial design on the base class, 
                    there were two functions that were absolutely vital needed to be included – namely, update and draw. These functions needed to be virtual, 
                    as they would be overwritten by the inheritor. </p>
                <h1 class="fontLoraBold"> Conclusion </h1>
                <p class=fontLoraSemiBold> 
                    In this project, I learnt efficient memory management, and how to apply object-oriented programming to a project. I gained a deeper understanding 
                    of the importance of breaking a program into steps. By planning individual modules in advance, the development of the engine and the game became substantially easier. 
                    <br>Additionally, this was the first project where I had applied object-oriented programming from scratch and was a valuable learning experience 
                    to apply for future projects.
