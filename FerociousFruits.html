                    <h1> Introduction </h1>
                    <p>
                        During my second semester of my first year, I attended a codejam. For our prompt, Bournemouth University’s sustainability team 
                        had us develop a prototype of an interactive experience that the team could use to educate other people on BU’s net zero promise. 
                        As our team consisted primarily of Creative Technology students, we decided to cater towards the younger target market and make a 
                        game. During the planning stage, we felt it best if we made a real-time strategy game where the player takes control of the university’s 
                        budget for a year and tries to keep the students happy. Although we had a time constraint of just under a week, our team had managed to 
                        win the ‘Most Visually Appealing’ award given to us by the codejam’s judging board.
                    </p>
                    <h1> My Role </h1>
                    <p>
                        When we originally started the project, each team member was given a role. My role was to create the ‘foundation’ for 
                        the game and ensure everything in the hierarchy interacted and communicated well with each other.
                    </p>
                    <h2> The Foundation </h2>
                    <p class="subtitleText"> 
                        When we originally created a rough design for our game, we needed to come up with a way for our elements to interact with each other. 
                        I had decided that the main way of communication between objects would occur when the camera interacted with a building. This way, 
                        I could use the camera to identify which building was clicked and could communicate with the other scripts made by my team members. 
                        As this was a smaller scale project and we had team members who weren’t experts at unity, I had made the decision to exclude managers 
                        from the project. Although efficient, the other team members would end up confused, so in the end, the option to use the camera and the 
                        buildings became the superior choice.
                        <br><br>
                        Every frame, a building would check if it was in focus by the camera. If it was, open the shop.
                    </p>
                    <div class="inlineMediaContainer singleMedia">
                        <img src="assets/images/FerociousFruitsSnippet3.png">
                    </div>
                    <p class="subtitleText">
                        Ultimately, this method proved successful, keeping the game resource-efficient and keeping the hierarchy small and clean for the other team members.
                    </p>
                    <h2> Camera Work </h2>
                    <p class="subtitleText"> 
                        Moving on, I decided to work on the camera next. This was my first time working with cameras to this degree (usually the camera would be in a static location 
                        or moving orthogonally), so this proved to be a refreshing challenge. I tried a few options but never seemed to get it correct. What did work for me, 
                        however, was using a point that the camera would follow. While it created the illusion that the camera was moving, there was an invisible box that 
                        the camera was always trained on. I messed around with cinemachine to give the camera some smooth movement, but the majority of the movement was done by the point.
                    </p>
                    <div class="inlineMediaContainer singleMedia">
                        <img src="assets/images/FerociousFruitsSnippet1.png">
                    </div>
                    <p class="subtitleText">
                        When the player clicks on a building, the look-at point moves towards an anchor point contained by each building. The script responsible for camera movement also 
                        allows the player to move the camera by scrolling. To do this, the script grabs the mouse location relative to the viewport and calculates the direction it needs 
                        to move when the mouse is released.
                    </p>
                    <div class="inlineMediaContainer">

                    </div>
                    <p class="subtitleText">
                        Combining these two elements gave our team a streamlined script that handled movement, both from user input and from the game. I didn’t want many scripts affecting 
                        the camera, mostly due to the fact that if there were some unexpected behaviour, it would be hard to debug. Implementing this script gave us this:

                    <h1> What did we learn? </h1>
                    <p> 
                        As soon as we got started, one limitation became painfully apparent: Unity was not made for collaborative working using a tool like GitHub. We kept running into 
                        merge errors and had to keep rolling back the repo to get to a playable version. Once we got past that hurdle and began making progress, we all learnt the 
                        importance of teamwork and communication with one another. Collaborating on this codejam brought us closer together, and we emerged not just as better developers, 
                        but as a cohesive team ready to tackle future challenges.
