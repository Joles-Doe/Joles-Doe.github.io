                    <h1> Introduction </h1>
                    <p>
                        During my second semester of my first year, I had attended a codejam. For our prompt, the Bournemouth University’s sustainability team 
                        had us develop a prototype of an interactive experience that the team could use to educate other people on BU’s net zero promise. 
                        As our team was consisted primarily of Creative Technology students, we decided to pander towards the younger target market and make a 
                        game. During the planning stage, we felt it best if we made a Real-Time Strategy game, where the player takes control of the University’s 
                        budget for a year and tries to keep the students happy. Although we had a time constraint of just under a week, our team had managed to 
                        win the ‘Most Visually Appealing’ award given to us by the codejam’s judging board.

                    <h1> My Role </h1>
                    <p>
                        When we originally made a start on the project, each of us in the team gave ourselves a role. My role was to create the ‘foundation’ for 
                        the game, ensure everything in the hierarchy interacted and communicated well with each other, and worked on the camera features on the side.
