                <h1> Introduction </h1>
                <p>
                    During my first year of University, I got to grips with some game engines and their inner workings. One such engine was Unity – 
                    I liked this engine because it offered a nice balance between flexibility and ease of use. The interface and general layout 
                    made it easy for beginners to work with. After a few months of getting to grips with the engine, I wanted to make a small game 
                    to apply what I had learnt. Although I had difficulty deciding on what game to make, I decided to recreate one of my favourite 
                    minigames from Wii Fit – Table Tilt. Additionally, I gave myself a limited timeframe to emulate a deadline in the games industry. 
                    I used this deadline to gauge how much progress I could make in a month or so, and when I finished the project, could look back and 
                    evaluate what needed to be improved for the future.
                </p>
                <h1> Plate rotation </h1>
                <p>
                    During the planning stage, I highlighted the main components of the game. One such component was the plate rotation. Rotation is a 
                    completely different kettle of fish to basic movement, which meant I needed to learn how to use units such as Quaternions to 
                    rotate the plate to my liking. When creating the program to rotate the plate, I had came across the same problem multiple times – 
                    gimbal lock. When a ball falls, I needed to rotate the plate 90 degrees. However, that plate would refuse to move. To remedy this 
                    problem, I used Euler units to rotate my plate. When the program was finished, I had a plate that checked for mouse movement, clamped 
                    the input if it exceeded a certain amount, and smoothly rotated the plate an appropriate amount.

                <h1> Managers </h1>
                <p> 
                    Whilst developing Wacko Tilt, I wanted to trial an idea I had thought up during the planning stage. The majority of games I had made 
                    using Unity had scripts that were very large, as most objects were communicating with each other. In order to combat script size, I 
                    wanted to try and make managers for Wacko Tilt. For example, all the plates present in Wacko Tilt communicate with a plate manager 
                    if changes needed to be made. This manager then communicates with the game manager, that controls the game state and relays that 
                    information elsewhere. I was quite pleased with how this turned out, so I decided to keep these managers in my final build.
                </p>
                <h1> What have I learnt? </h1>
                <p class=fontLoraSemiBold> 
                    In this project, I gained a deeper understanding of rotation mechanics and the importance choosing the correct mathematical representation 
                    for different scenarios. Working with Euler units helped me appreciate the complexity of 3D space and the difficulty of moving 
                    objects within it. 
                    <br>Additionally, with the limited timeframe, I learnt the value of iterative development. By experimenting 
                    with different mechanics, I was able to refine specific ideas and streamline development time. This project showed to me the 
                    importance of adaptability and my ability to solve problems.
