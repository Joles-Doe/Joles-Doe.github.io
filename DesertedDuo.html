                    <h1> Introduction </h1>
                    <p>
                        During my second year, I had decided to take part in BFX's 2024 game jam with four others. For our prompt, 
                        we were given the theme of 'connection'. During the planning stage, we felt it best if we made a local multiplayer 
                        game, as we felt teamwork fit into the theme well. Although we had a time constraint of around 48 hours, our team 
                        had managed to win first place and received awards for best mechanics and best 3D art.
                    </p>
                    <h1> My Role </h1>
                    <p>
                        When we started the project, each team member was given a role. I was given the role of 'programming lead' and 
                        was responsible for creating the mechanics and ensuring everything was properly cleaned up and interacted with each other without problems.
                    </p>
                    <h1> Mechanics </h1>
                    <p>
                        Deserted Duo has one major gimmick: at the beginning, the player is constrained only to movement. They are unable 
                        to jump, climb, or perform any other actions apart from moving. The way the players are supposed to navigate the 
                        environment is by dropping and picking up their keybinds. For example, you could drop your down movement 
                        keybind and pick up the jump keybind instead.
                        <br><br>
                        In order to implement this, we used enumerators in order to identify which keybinds the player held.
                    </p>
                    <div class="inlineMediaContainer singleMedia">
                        <img src="assets/images/DesertedDuoSnippet1.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        When the player pressed a key, the movement script would check which block existed in that particular key and respond accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <h1> Respawning and Checkpoints </h1>
                    <p>
                        Due to the nature of the ragdolls implemented by the other team members, changing their position in a script appeared to have 
                        resulted in unusual behaviour. To remedy this issue, I had decided to store the players as prefabs and created a clone at the 
                        checkpoint. In order to accomplish this, I needed to have added two things: checkpoints throughout the level and a script that 
                        would re-enter any needed information the player had before they died.
                        <br><br>
                        Firstly, I started on the checkpoints. I created a bunch of squares and set them as triggers. Once triggered, it would call a 
                        parent function and pass through the player and the trigger's location:
                    </p>
                    <div class="inlineMediaContainer singleMedia">
                        <img src="assets/images/DesertedDuoSnippet2.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        If the player was the one colliding with the checkpoint and didn't already have that checkpoint stored, would call the component on the player to store that checkpoint location.
                        <br><br>
                        Next was the respawn mechanic. I created a script with a function that, when called, would grab the player that needed to respawn, 
                        re-instantiate them in the world, and give them all the necessary components that they would need.
                    </p>
                    <div class="inlineMediaContainer singleMedia">
                        <img src="assets/images/DesertedDuoSnippet3.png">
                    </div>
                    <h1> What did I learn? </h1>
                    <p> 
                        In this project, I got to experience firsthand the development pipeline that occurs when creating a game. As lead programmer, 
                        I got to see how other team members created their parts of the game and the problem-solving skills I had to employ in order to get those elements to work with the rest of the game.
                        Overall, I was extremely pleased with how Deserted Duo came about and cannot wait to take part in BFX 2025.
