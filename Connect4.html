                    <h1> Introduction </h1>
                    <p>
                        After tinkering around with Pygame during my time in Highschool and College, I wanted to make a small 
                        game to refresh my programming skills before I began University. After thinking about which game I wanted 
                        to make, I decided on Connect 4. I wanted to try something I hadn’t done before at that point, so I had 
                        decided to add online play functionality to the game.
                    </p>
                    <h1> Game Logic </h1>
                    <p>
                        The goal of Connect 4 is self-explanatory - get 4 counters in a row, diagonally or orthogonally, 
                        and you win. The challenge here was to create a function that grabbed each counter location and checked 
                        if any matching counters were nearby. To get started, I organised the board into a dictionary, with each 
                        row acting as a key. I put this into a function that resets the grid each time a new round starts.
                    </p>
                    <div class="inlineMediaContainer singleMedia">
                        <img src="assets/images/Connect4Snippet1.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Next, I have the player pick a column to place their counter in. This function quickly checks if the 
                        column is full or invalid. If the counter can be placed in that column, 
                        the function places it in the furthest row it can.
                    </p>
                    <div class="inlineMediaContainer singleMedia">
                        <img src="assets/images/Connect4Snippet2.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Once the counter is placed, the player's turn ends, and the next player gets to place a counter. Before the 
                        turn is transferred to the other player, the program checks if the player just gone has won. First, it checks the diagonals — 
                        the program splits the board into 3 sections. In the left section, the program checks if there are four counters together, 
                        moving from left to right. In the right section, it checks for four counters moving from right to left. In the middle section, 
                        it does both. I decided to do it this way primarily since in the left and right sections, it’s only for there to be four in a 
                        row in one direction. By limiting the direction the program checks, I reduce the amount of checking the program must do.
                    </p>
                    <div class="inlineMediaContainer largerMedia">

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the program completes the vertical and horizontal checks. This uses string concatenation instead of counters, and if it 
                        identifies that there’s 4 of the same letter in the string, returns true.
                    </p>

                    <h1> Online Play </h1>
                    <p> 
                        I briefly mentioned in the introduction that I wanted to add online play to the game. This was my first time using networking 
                        of any kind, so trying to find what to use ended up being a bit of a struggle. I decided to have each program create HTTP 
                        requests to a key store, giving the impression that there was online play. The key store would hold the grid and whose turn 
                        it was. Every so often, each program would request the data from the key store and check the turn. If it was their turn, 
                        download the new grid and take their turn.
                        <br><br>
                        When the host creates a game, they’re given an ID. This ID is the key to a part of the keystore, where the information will be passed in between players.
                    </p>
                    <div class="inlineMediaContainer singleMedia">
                        <img src="assets/images/Connect4Snippet7.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        One huge problem here was that Windows mistook the waiting phase of the program as not responding. To remedy this, 
                        I had Pygame pump events until the other player eventually joined the game.
                    </p>
                    <div class="inlineMediaContainer singleMedia">
                        <img src="assets/images/Connect4Snippet8.png">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The main game loop functionally remained the same. If it wasn’t their turn, the program would just keep patiently pumping events until the data was passed back over.
                    </p>
                    <h1> What did I learn? </h1>
                    <p> 
                        In this project, I learnt the basics of networking and the management of events in a game engine. Designing the game logic helped 
                        improve my problem-solving skills; I utilised these skills to structure functions for checking if a player has won and other game states.
